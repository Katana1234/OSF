in 0.1.13
- hall positions based on regression tests
- foc multiplier hardcoded to 14
- current averaging over a whole rotation


in 0.1.14
- foc multiplier hardcoded on 30 (seems better on test done by ebikestuff with 18A at more than 3000 rpm)
- foc angle follow current (so avoid filtering on 16)
- add a define in order to split ramp up/down ( based on 2X rates) from duty cycle updates (now at each pwm cyccle)
- replace current averaging on one rotation by a huge filtering ( to avoid huge duty cycle variations at low erps when averaging current would be applied several time in one full rotation)
